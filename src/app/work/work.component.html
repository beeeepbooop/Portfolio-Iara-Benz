        <p>
            Mental illnesses can be hidden, complex, and uncomfortable.  However, in order to break stigmas and create a positive world, it is important to face them head-on. This led to "Was wir nicht sehen" (transl. what we don't see), a concept for a video game that was designed as part of my bachelor's thesis. It tackles the topic of depression by letting players step into the mind of a person suffering from depression. The players guide the character through her negative feelings and help her in overcoming her struggles. This game playfully addresses mental health and the importance of reducing biases.        </p>

In the short book the spider overcomes new challenges, allowing itself to gain confidence and new perspectives. This story book should encourage its young readers to be brave, choose their own path and enjoy their differences. The book design is simple and effective through its limited color scheme and the  use of adorable characters. Also the hand-lettered text is easy to read by young children.

            "Bun's Adventures!" is a concept for an animated children's show about the adventurous little bunny "Bun", who is always up to new and exciting antics with his friends. Shown here is a hand-animated intro scene for the show, that gives viewers insights into Bun's life and the show. In order to not be too visually stimulating for its young viewers the show has been deliberately kept simple, with easily recognizable characters, limited colors and the use of empty space.
